# Introduction

Electric utilities have begun to replace traditional analog meters with “smart meters”. Smart meters are much more efficient for utility providers, because they provide up-to-date information and can do many things remotely that required numerous employees to handle in the past.
Also, with smart meters, detecting abnormal usage like tampering or electricity theft will be easier.
